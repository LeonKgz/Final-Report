% \chapter{Evaluation Plan}
% % "Evaluation plan (1-2 pages). Project evaluation is very important, so it's important to think now about how you plan to measure success. For example, what functionality do you need to demonstrate?  What experiments to you need to undertake and what outcome(s) would constitute success?  What benchmarks should you use? How has your project extended the state of the art?  How do you measure qualitative aspects, such as ease of use?  These are the sort of questions that your project evaluation should address; this section should outline your plan."

% The ultimate end goal of the project would be training an RL deep neural network model algorithm that would outperform the existing Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism for optimizing data rates, airtime and energy consumption in a LoRaWAN network.\\

% The most relevant aspects of LoRaWAN communication to us are Energy efficiency and Data Extraction Rate over a noisy channel. The final evaluation would involve conducting experiments with the simulator described above running 2 algorithms against each other.
